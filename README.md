# Thomas–Fiering Model for Synthetic Streamflow Generation

This repository implements the **Thomas–Fiering model**, a classic stochastic hydrology method used for generating **synthetic monthly streamflow data** that preserves the mean, variance, and inter-month correlation of historical records.

##  Files Included
- `thomas_fiering_model.py` → Python implementation of the Thomas-Fiering model.
- `Test Data.xlsx` → Example input data (historical monthly flows). (Change the data as per required but keep the framework of excel sheet intact)
- `README.md` → Documentation and formulas.

##  Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas openpyxl
